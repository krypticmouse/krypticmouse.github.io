      <description>Compilers are not a game of luck.
If you want it to work, code hard.

 Another blog, another butchered quote but what matters is that they never created a season 2 for this series and I&amp;rsquo;m max pissed about it!! Anyways, as someone who has a Computer Science Degree, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit shameful for me to admit that I never formally studied compilers, well in my defense it&amp;rsquo;s because it was an elective and I chose an ML elective instead of Compiler Design.</description>

      <title>LIMA: Less is More for Alignment</title>
      <link>https://journal.herumbshandilya.com/posts/lima/</link>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t even being to explain how I felt reading this paper, the moment I finished it I shared it ASAP with everyone because it deserved it. Essentially, what LIMA wants to address is that big instruction dataset and RLHF aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary to produce high quality output.
As I mentioned above, what LIMA wants to address is that big instruction dataset and RLHF aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary to produce high quality output. But aside from that it&amp;rsquo;s an investigation on how much examples are needed to align a model output?</description>

      <description>Attention is Transformer’s breath,
Multi-Head is Transformer’s release,
RNNs thou wert and art,
May thy model reach to greater accuracy.

 I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired of butchering anime and video game quotes so I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I should butcher some meme quotes next time. Anyways, well I have been writing on a lot of topics but something I always wanted to write about is probably explaining a research paper.</description>

      <description>When I was a young man,
I had liberty but I didn’t see it,
I had time but I didn’t know it,
And I had PyTorch Lightning but I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it.
- Newbie PyTorch User
 Another Blog another great video game quote butchered by these hands. Anyways, when I was getting started with PyTorch one of the things that made me jealous was the fact that Tensorflow has so much support for monitoring the model performance.</description>

      <title>Class Imbalance comes in Like a Lion</title>

      <description>In a world without class imbalance we might&amp;rsquo;ve been heroes.
- Neural Networks
 Keeping aside the fact that I butchered one of the greatest Video Game quotes of all time class imbalance can be a tricky thing to handle especially if you are a beginner. When I first encountered class imbalance I treated it normally, I know right, and not just that I measured the accuracy to judge the performance.</description>

      <title>Training SVM over Custom Kernels</title>

      <description>One thing that always intrigued me about ML is that the more you learn about it the more you realize how little you know. One such case that happened to me a few months ago when a person asked me if I could help him in SVM and me being me I was like sure not a big deal. It was a big deal.
Most of us might be familiar with training models.</description>
